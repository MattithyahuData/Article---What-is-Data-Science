Data is essentially the information of things. From when people could first write, that was data being recorded. You remebering what you need to buy at the grocery story is a form of data storage. 
 

Data is in our everyday lives, and it alwasy has been, its only been since the turn of the centruy its place in society has began to be valued more. Humans used to be the sole use of data storage but when computers emerged at being more efficient in this, it has compelted changed the way we live our lives. 

Secondly, *what is science?*. Science is the study of things. The Science council defines science as "the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence.". At the foundation of this pursuit and application of knowledge is information, i.e data. 


In summary, **data science** is any information that can be measured and quantified, and later researched for greater understanding. Data plays a big part in our everyday lives, it has been the unseen back bone of our society, it's what remebers how mcuh you have in your bank account so you do not have to worry, it is what stores your phone contacts, keeps your email reciepts, stores your shopping list in any form (digital / paper / memory), remebers where you need to go etc. Data is very important and the science of it is every growing.
