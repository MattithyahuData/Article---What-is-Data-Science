Firstly, *what is data?*. A good way to understand something is to look at the origin, when did 'data' come into existence? 
Data is essentially the information of things. From writing to typing, to remembering the birthday of a friend they are all forms of data. 
 

Data is in our everyday lives, and it always has been, since the turn of the century its place in society has begun to be valued more as knowledge and information has grown over the past 100 years or so. Humans used to be the sole use of data storage, but machines emerged and this all changed. 

Secondly, *what is science?*. Science is the study of things. The Science council defines science as "the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence." At the foundation of this pursuit and application of knowledge is information, i.e., data. 

In summary, **data science** is any information that can be measured and quantified, and later researched for greater understanding. Data plays a big part in our everyday lives, it has been the unseen back bone of our society, it's what remembers how much you have in your bank account so you do not have to remember (which is still a form of data storage by the way), it is what stores your phone contacts, keeps your email receipts, stores your shopping list in any form (digital / paper / memory), remembers where you need to go etc. Data is very important and the science of it is ever growing.
